## General info
This project is a simple model which predicts a successful protest.

Using python (libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn ..) analysing a dataset of protests and trying to find factors which make protests achieve their final goals.

## Description
Datasets used:
  - ['NAVCO 2.1 Dataset'](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MHOXDV) - Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes
  - ['World Population 1960-2018'](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/world-population-19602018) - Population of each country, 1960-2018

 __Main objective:__ See whether violence contributes to the success rate of protests.  <br />
 In this notebook we see the relationship between violence, size of the protest and success.
 
#### - `SizeAndSuccess.ipynb` <br />
 __Main objective:__ See whether larger protests are more likely to succeed.  <br />
 In this notebook we see the relationship between the size of a protest and its success. <br />
 We calculate the number of participants as # of total population and see what % is needed for a protest to succeed. <br />
 Then we compare the the protests in the dataset with the George Floyd and BLM movement worldwide protests to see differences. <br />
