## General info
This project is about analysing a dataset of protests and building simple model to predict a successful protest. <br />
Using python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn ..), trying to find factors which make protests achieve their final goals.

## Description
Datasets used:
  - ['NAVCO 2.1 Dataset'](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MHOXDV) - Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes
  - ['World Population 1960-2018'](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/world-population-19602018) - Population of each country, 1960-2018

      The projects presentation. <br />

__01.  `ViolenceAndSuccess.ipynb`__ <br />
      __Main objective :__ See whether violence contributes to the success rate of protests.  <br />
      In this notebook we see the relationship between violent / non-violent protests and their success. <br />
 
__02.  `SizeAndSuccess.ipynb`__ <br />
      __Main objective :__ See whether larger protests are more likely to succeed.  <br />
      In this notebook we see the relationship between the size of a protest and its success. <br />
      Comparing the protests in the dataset with the George Floyd and BLM movement worldwide protests to see differences. <br />

__03.  `ProtestSuccessPrediction.ipynb`__ <br />
     __Main objective :__ Build a model to predict a successful protest. <br />
      In this notebook we see an attempt to build a model which predict if a protest was successful or failed. <br />
      Using logistic regression, predicting the success of a protest. <br />
